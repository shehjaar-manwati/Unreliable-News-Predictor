# Unreliable-News-Predictor

Overview
The Unreliable News Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at determining the reliability of news articles. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and logistic regression, this project provides a tool to assess whether a news article is likely to be reliable or unreliable.

Features:
1. Data Collection: Scrapes news articles from various sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the text data for analysis.
3. Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
4. Model Training: Implements logistic regression to classify news articles.
5. Evaluation: Evaluates the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
